### Column view
Column view will display the content in a clean easy way to see the content:  
```bash
csv-viewer ./test/test.csv
```
or
```bash
csv-viewer --view column ./test/test.csv
```

Result: 
```
AAA      Description with a comma, and a quote "like this"     More text
BBB      Another description, with a newline like this         More text
```

> The spacing is similar to `column` gives you.

### Table view
```bash
csv-viewer --view table ./test/test.csv
```

Result:
```

```

### JSON view
```bash
csv-viewer --view json ./test/test.csv
```

Result:
```
[
    [
        "AAA",
        "Description with a comma, and a quote \"like this\"",
        "More text"
    ],
    [
        "AAA",
        "Another description, with a newline like this",
        "More text"
    ]
]
```

### Selecting columns to display
```bash
csv-viewer --columns="1,3" ./test/test.csv
```

Result:
```
AAA    More text
BBB    More text
```

Or you can change the position of display of the columns: 
```bash
csv-viewer --columns="3,1" ./test/test.csv
```

Result:
```
More text    AAA
More text    BBB
```

> This does not affect the usage on view options.

### What about other manipulations?
This tool is for the terminal environment and tries to follow the UNIX philosophy. 
So all this to say if you want to do other types of manipulations you will need to pipe it into other terminal utilities like `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `awk`, `sed`, etc.
